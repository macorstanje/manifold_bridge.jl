# manifold_bridge.jl
 
Repository with the code used for simulations of bridge processes on manifolds. Methods are in the `src` folder, code for simulations using the repository is in the `simulations` folder. Within the simulations folder, the following files are used for the article: 

- The file `hyperbolic_bridges_experiments` contain the bridge simulations of section 5.4 of the article, the file `makefigs.R` contain R-code for the visualization. 
- `Gibbs.jl` contains code for the Gibbs samples on the Torus
- `hyperbolic_gibbs` contains code for the Gibbs samples on the Poincare disk. 
- `torus_bridges.jl` contains the code used for simulating bridges on the Torus.
